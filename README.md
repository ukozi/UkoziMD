The MDS-PC2 is a home MiniDisc deck designed to connect to a HiFi system. It was released in 1999 with a special party trick, though. As the model name implies, the PC2 could be connected to a PC via Serial/RS232 and you could title tracks with your PC’s keyboard, begin recording from a CD player or tape deck, and split or merge tracks all from Windows using the included “MD Editor 2” software from Sony. The problem with using it today is that it was designed for 1024x768 resolution screens running Windows 98.

UkoziMD is a modern Mac app to talk over PCLK-2 to an MDS-PC2 minidisc unit. While it will eventually include all of the editing functionality of MD Editor it is currently a remote control for playback.
